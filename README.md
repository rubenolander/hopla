# hop.la

A game where you travel upwards hopefully faster than your competition.

This was created as a learning project to get more hands on experience with class based development as well as reading and understanding documentation from third parties, in this case the PIXI.js and Matter.js libraries.

The game is deployed [here](https://hopla.vercel.app/) but you can also clone repository and run npm install on a local machine if you'd like.
